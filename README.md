# Cube-Projection-Visualisation
•	This is a rotating cube projection visualisation made in python using the pygame library
•	This project uses matrix multiplication to rotate and project 3D vertices onto a 2D screen
•	I have also implemented an algorithm to determine which faces of the cube should render in front
